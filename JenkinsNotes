Go Jenkins and create a new Job
    Job is every project we create in Jenkins

 Steps to creating a Job
    1)Click  on new Item
    2)Enter name and click on Maven Project
    3)Source Code from Git. Jenkins is linked with Gitub and pulls the code automatically from there
        We need to add the link of the repo we want it to link with

    4) We don't want to specify any branch
    5) POM.xml
        POM file is used by Jenkins to run our Cucumber Framework
    6)In goals and options we need to mention the runner class we want to run from
        command - clean install -Dtest=Smoke



   Headless Browser using ChromeOptions
   -There is no chrome browser installed in Jenkins so we wont be able to open chrome browser when we run it
            -We need to use headless browser

    Parameterization
        We can set certain parameters for our job to run on
        Check the option "This project is paramaterized"
        From add paramater select "Choic Paramter"
        Name it and then put all the choices
        Then we change the goals and options to  clean install -Dtest=$(name of parameter)


   How to configure for reports
    Go to configure and click on add post build actoins
    select cucmber reports
    click on advanced
    include the path of report
        **/* cucumber.json


   PIPELINES IN JENKINS
    Developers will push their code to github and that will be linked with Jenkins to automatically build and run the code
        When everything is good in the dev environment then its time to go in QA environment

        We need to link all projects (dev,qa...) by configuring from first one and selecting post build projects
        Then click on Build other projects Dev->QA
            Once DEV build is done successfully then QA will run
